# The Meridian Solution

Meridian is **the blockchain built for stablecoin remittance**. This dual-layer system enables real-time, direct settlement with counterparties, completely eliminating payment failures and the need for costly prefunding of partners and local accounts.

## How It Works

By facilitating access to a globally discoverable network of vetted, compliant institutions, Meridian dramatically reduces the operational costs, counterparty risks, and complexities associated with traditional cross-border payments.

Remittance and payments companies can transact **directly, instantly, and with cryptographic certainty**, fundamentally reshaping their liquidity management and operational models.

Banks and mobile wallets ensure that they receive the dollars directly for each transaction, improving their margins and liquidity.

<Info>
**Cost Reduction**: Meridian eliminates all third parties from the transaction, reducing the cost of remittance payments by **as much as 90%**.

## Core Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct USD Stablecoin Settlement" icon="handshake">
    Enable remittance companies and financial institutions to connect and settle transactions directly and instantly with each other via USD stablecoins, eliminating third parties, high fees, and settlement delays.

    The financial institutions credit their customer directlyâ€”no more payment failures and third-party liquidity issues.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-Time Without Prefunding" icon="clock">
    By settling the recipient's institution directly, remittance and payments companies send transfers in real-time as the customer transacts.

    Send **100 USD stablecoins** as the payment is happening, not $10,000,000 wires multiple days in advance.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Dynamic Institutional Network" icon="globe">
    A private "one-to-many registry" allows remittance and payments companies to discover and transact with any financial institution on the network directly without bespoke contracting, relationships, or integrations.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Sovereign Ecosystems" icon="shield-check">
    Build on a "network of networks" model where institutions can deploy their own private, permissioned applications on the shared blockchain infrastructure.

    FIs gain granular control to set their own compliance rules and protect sensitive commercial data, while the underlying on-chain settlement provides an immutable and transparent ledger for seamless regulatory auditing.

## Ensuring Dollar Flow

Banks and financial institutions can ensure they receive the dollars they need for the remittance payments flowing into their systems and remain fully compliant in countries that require onshoring.

Instead of intermediaries capturing the USD, receiving institutions get:
- **Direct USD stablecoin transfers** credited to their accounts
- **Immediate liquidity** without settlement delays
- **Full transparency** into incoming payment flows
- **Compliance-ready** audit trails

# Meridian Chain Architecture

Meridian is a **sovereign Layer 1 blockchain** that provides full control over its own execution environment, validator set, and economic model. This architecture offers performance isolation while leveraging the core security benefits of a foundational public network.

## Sovereign L1 Design

As a sovereign L1, Meridian maintains:

- **Independent validators**: Purpose-selected financial institutions
- **Custom token economics**: Tailored for institutional settlement use cases
- **Flexible gas policies**: Optimized for predictable transaction costs
- **Full governance control**: Ability to fine-tune performance and rules

This sovereignty allows Meridian to optimize specifically for institutional stablecoin settlement without sacrificing scalability or reliability.

## Consensus Mechanism

### High-Performance Snowman Consensus

The underlying consensus mechanism is **purpose-built for processing transactions in a linear, ordered sequence**. This makes it exceptionally fast and efficient for complex operations like smart contract execution.

Key characteristics:
- Linear transaction ordering ensures predictable execution
- Optimized for high-value financial settlement
- Efficient handling of smart contract interactions
- Low computational overhead

### Rapid & Irreversible Finality

The protocol achieves agreement through a **lightweight and rapid polling process among validators**. This allows transactions to be confirmed and finalized in seconds, providing the certainty required for high-value settlement.

<Info>
**Finality**: Transactions reach irreversible finality in **1-2 seconds**, providing near-instant confirmation for institutional settlement.
</Info>

## Proof-of-Authority (PoA) Model

Meridian uses a **permissioned Proof-of-Authority consensus** where block production is handled exclusively by a vetted set of known, trusted institutions.

### Why PoA for Institutional Settlement?

  <Card title="Identity-Based Security" icon="id-card">
    Security is derived from validator identity and reputation, not from staked capital. This aligns the network's integrity with the real-world accountability of its operators.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Validator Requirements

All validators on the Meridian network must:

1. **Pass KYB Screening**: Stringent know-your-business verification
2. **Be Licensed Entities**: Regulated financial institutions with proper credentials
3. **Maintain Infrastructure**: Run reliable, performant validator nodes
4. **Opt-in for Discovery**: Choose whether to participate in the broader institutional registry
5. **Comply with Network Rules**: Adhere to governance and operational standards

## Performance Specifications

Meridian launches with consensus-level performance guarantees:

<ResponseField name="Finality" type="1-2 seconds" required>
  Near-instant probabilistic finality with cryptographic certainty
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Latency" type="<2 seconds" required>
  Transactions typically confirmed in under 2 seconds
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Throughput" type="4,500+ TPS" required>
  Capable of processing 4,500+ transactions per second across the network under optimal conditions
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Block Time" type="~2 seconds" required>
  Consistent block production for predictable settlement
</ResponseField>

### Real-World Performance

For institutional settlement use cases:

- **Single remittance payment**: Confirmed in 1-2 seconds
- **Batch settlement**: 100 payments processed in ~2 seconds
- **High-volume corridor**: Support for thousands of simultaneous transactions
- **Peak capacity**: Network can handle 4,500+ TPS burst loads

## EVM Compatibility

Meridian is built on **existing EVM blockchain infrastructure** but maintains full sovereignty. This provides:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Developer Benefits">
    - **Familiar tooling**: Use standard Ethereum development tools
    - **Smart contract compatibility**: Deploy Solidity contracts
    - **Easy integration**: Standard JSON-RPC interfaces
    - **Rich ecosystem**: Leverage existing libraries and frameworks
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Institutional Benefits">
    - **Proven technology**: Battle-tested EVM execution environment
    - **Security**: Well-audited virtual machine
    - **Interoperability**: Potential bridging to other EVM chains
    - **Maturity**: Years of production use and optimization
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Network of Networks Model

Meridian operates as a **"network of networks"** where institutions can deploy their own private, permissioned applications on shared blockchain infrastructure.

### Multi-Layer Design

Meridian's architecture consists of two key layers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Private Application Layer (Institution-Specific)" icon="shield">
    Each financial institution can deploy its own private, permissioned application with:
    - **Custom compliance rules** tailored to their jurisdiction
    - **Proprietary business logic** for their specific use cases
    - **Private data storage** for sensitive commercial information
    - **Granular access controls** for their counterparties

    Examples: Institution A runs a private app with Nigerian banking compliance rules, while Institution B runs a separate app with Kenyan mobile money compliance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shared Settlement Layer (L1 Blockchain)" icon="link">
    All institutions share a common Layer 1 blockchain for settlement:
    - **USD Stablecoin Transfers**: Direct peer-to-peer settlement
    - **Immutable Audit Trail**: Permanent record of all settlements
    - **Cryptographic Certainty**: Verifiable proof of transactions
    - **Consensus Security**: PoA validation by vetted institutions

    This shared layer enables interoperability while preserving institutional sovereignty.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security Model

### Multi-Layer Security

1. **Validator Identity**: Known, regulated financial institutions
2. **Reputation-Based**: Validators have real-world accountability
3. **Cryptographic Verification**: All transactions cryptographically signed
4. **Immutable Ledger**: Tamper-proof transaction history
5. **Distributed Consensus**: Multiple validators must agree on state

### Compliance & Auditing

- **Immutable audit trails**: Every transaction permanently recorded
- **Selective transparency**: Institutions control who sees what
- **Regulatory access**: Authorized regulators can audit transactions
- **Privacy preservation**: Customer data never on public blockchain

# Meridian Protocol API

This API reference provides comprehensive documentation for integrating your financial institution with the Meridian network and RADIUS Protocol.

## Overview

The Meridian API enables:
- **Institution registration** in the RADIUS registry
- **Discovery** of vetted counterparties
- **Credential verification** using verifiable credentials
- **Handshake initiation** for compliant settlement
- **Transaction execution** with cryptographic certainty

The Meridian network is a sovereign Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for stablecoin remittance and cross-border payments between financial institutions.

## API Architecture

### RADIUS Registry

The RADIUS Protocol includes an **on-chain Registry smart contract** that maintains verified records of financial institutions:

- **Institution identity**: Name, jurisdiction, and regulatory information
- **Verifiable credentials**: KYB credentials and licenses
- **Service offerings**: Remittance receiving, settlement, on/off-ramps
- **Geographic coverage**: Supported currencies and countries
- **Contact endpoints**: API endpoints for integration

### RESTful API Layer

The API provides a developer-friendly interface for:

- **Registry queries**: Discover institutions by jurisdiction, currency, or service
- **Credential verification**: Validate counterparty credentials
- **Handshake management**: Initiate and manage RADIUS handshakes
- **Transaction settlement**: Execute on-chain settlements
- **Compliance data exchange**: Private Travel Rule data exchange

### Integration Benefits

- **Single integration**: Connect to all network institutions through one API
- **Cryptographic security**: All operations cryptographically signed
- **Real-time settlement**: 1-2 second finality
- **Built-in compliance**: Automated Travel Rule compliance
- **Privacy-preserving**: Sensitive data never exposed publicly

## Use Cases

The Meridian API supports multiple institutional use cases:

### Remittance Senders
- Discover receiving institutions in target countries
- Verify counterparty credentials
- Initiate compliant handshakes with Travel Rule data
- Execute direct USD stablecoin settlements
- Eliminate prefunding requirements

### Remittance Receivers
- Register to receive remittance payments
- Accept handshake requests from vetted senders
- Perform compliance checks on incoming payments
- Credit beneficiary accounts instantly
- Receive USD directly without intermediaries

### Banks & Financial Institutions
- Offer instant cross-border settlement to customers
- Maintain full control with permissioned applications
- Meet regulatory requirements with built-in compliance
- Access global network without bilateral relationships

## Who Uses This API?

The Meridian API is designed for:

- **Remittance Companies**: Money transfer operators and payment service providers
- **Banks**: Traditional and digital banks offering cross-border services
- **Fintech Companies**: Innovative payment platforms and wallets

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using:
- **API Key**: Provided during onboarding (`X-API-Key` header)
- **Private Key**: For signing transactions (stored securely, never transmitted)
- **Institution ID**: Your unique institution identifier

Example request:
```bash
curl https://api.meridian.network/v1/registry/query \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jurisdiction": "US"}'
```

## SDKs

Official SDKs are available for:

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```bash
npm install @meridian/sdk
```

### Python
```bash
pip install meridian-sdk
```

See the [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) for detailed SDK usage examples.

## OpenAPI Specification

This documentation is auto-generated from our OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification. The API endpoints appear in the sidebar.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and structured error responses:

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid API key |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

Example error response:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
    "message": "Institution credentials could not be verified",
    "details": {
      "credential_type": "KYB",
      "reason": "Expired license"
    }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

API endpoints have the following rate limits:
- **Registry queries**: 100 requests/minute
- **Handshake operations**: 1000 requests/minute
- **Settlement transactions**: 5000 requests/minute

Rate limit information is included in response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets

# Meridian Protocol

**The Blockchain Built for Stablecoin Remittance & Cross-Border Payments**

Meridian is a sovereign Layer 1 blockchain that enables remittance companies and financial institutions to settle transactions directly and instantly with USD stablecoins, eliminating third parties, high fees, and settlement delays.

## The Challenge

Traditional remittance and cross-border payments involve up to 7 institutions between sender and recipient, all taking their cut. This complexity drives average global remittance costs to **6.65%** (World Bank, Q2 2024) and creates:

- **High transaction costs** from multiple intermediaries
- **Expensive prefunding** requiring millions in idle capital
- **Unreliable settlement** with multi-day delays and high failure rates
- **Dollar capture** by intermediaries instead of receiving banks

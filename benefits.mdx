# Benefits for All Stakeholders

Meridian fundamentally transforms the economics and operations of cross-border payments for both remittance companies and receiving financial institutions.

## For Remittance Companies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Instant Settlement with No Third-Party Dependencies" icon="bolt">
    Eliminate the complex web of correspondent banks, payment aggregators, and intermediaries. Settle directly with the receiving institution in 1-2 seconds with cryptographic certainty.

    **Impact**:
    - Zero payment failures due to intermediary issues
    - No multi-day reconciliation processes
    - Real-time confirmation for customers
    - Simplified operational workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Eliminate International Banking and B2B FinTech Middlemen Fees" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    Cut out all intermediary fees that typically consume 5-7% of transaction value. Pay only network transaction fees instead of layers of banking charges, aggregator margins, and processing fees.

    **Impact**:
    - Reduce transaction costs by up to 90%
    - Pass savings to customers or improve margins
    - Predictable, transparent fee structure
    - No hidden FX markups or intermediary charges
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Prefunding—Send Money Live as Customers Transact" icon="gauge-high">
    Eliminate the need to maintain millions in prefunded accounts across corridors. Send the exact amount needed when the customer transacts, freeing up capital for growth.

    **Impact**:
    - Free up $5-10M+ in working capital per corridor
    - Reduce cost of capital by several basis points daily
    - Eliminate idle fund opportunity costs
    - Improve cash flow and capital efficiency

## For Banks & Financial Institutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Receive USD Directly—No More Middlemen Taking Your Dollars" icon="building-columns">

    - Improve USD liquidity positions
    - Capture the full value of incoming remittances

    - Strengthen balance sheets with direct USD access
  </Accordion>

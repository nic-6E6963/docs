# The Problem with Traditional Remittance

Remittance payments today are extremely complex with as many as **7 institutions standing between the sender and recipient**, all taking their cut of the transaction and trying to claim the dollars.

This complexity is why average global remittance costs are still **6.65%** (World Bank, Q2 2024).

## High Transaction Costs

Remittance and cross-border payments are subject to exorbitant fees from multiple intermediaries, disproportionately affecting the senders and recipients.

Each institution in the payment chain extracts value:
- Sending banks charge origination fees
- Intermediary banks take processing fees
- Currency exchange providers apply unfavorable rates with hidden markups
- Receiving banks charge deposit fees
- Payment aggregators add their margins

For a $200 remittance payment, these fees can total $13-15, representing nearly 7% of the transfer amount.

## Prefunding is Exorbitantly Expensive

Payments companies are expected to deliver constantly and consistentlyâ€”**24/7 liquidity is critical**.

Accessing several million USD to prefund accounts and local currency positions costs several basis points daily, either in:
- **Direct cost of capital**: Interest and opportunity cost on tied-up funds
- **Lost revenue**: Idle funds that could be deployed productively elsewhere

Example: A remittance company operating in 10 corridors might need to maintain $5-10M in prefunded positions across partner banks and local accounts. At current interest rates, this represents hundreds of thousands in annual carrying costs.

## Unreliable Settlement and Middlemen

The multi-layered nature of the system leads to:

- **High failure rates** for payments due to multiple points of failure
- **Settlement times of several days**, creating capital inefficiency and hindering economic activity
- **Dependency chains**: Big aggregators often use other aggregators, adding several layers of dependencies that frequently fail

When a payment fails:
- Funds are held in limbo
- Recipients wait days or weeks
- Companies face customer service costs and reputational damage
- Reconciliation becomes complex and time-consuming

## Control of the Dollars

While the banks and financial institutions on the receiving side need the dollars, **the USD is often taken by**:

- The sending bank
- Intermediaries and correspondent banks
- Third-party payment providers
- Aggregators and payment facilitators

This means:
- Receiving banks lose out on USD liquidity they need
- Margins are compressed for institutions actually serving end customers
- The value is captured by intermediaries who add limited value
- Regulatory requirements for USD onshoring become harder to satisfy

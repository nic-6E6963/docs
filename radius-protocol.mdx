# RADIUS Protocol

**Discoverability within the Network**

Meridian replaces the need for costly, pre-established banking relationships with an open, real-time network for institutional settlement, powered by the **RADIUS Protocol**.

RADIUS enables financial institutions to discover vetted counterparties, verify their credentials, establish secure communication channels, and settle transactions—all without pre-existing relationships or bespoke integrations.

## How RADIUS Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover Vetted Partners Instantly">
    All licensed institutions running nodes on the network can opt-in for discovery. Once opted in, they appear in the RADIUS registry with verified credentials and service offerings.

    **The Registry Contains**:
    - Institution identity and legal information
    - Regulatory licenses and jurisdictions
    - Supported services (remittance, settlement, on/off-ramps)
    - Geographic coverage and currency support
    - Verifiable credentials issued by trusted authorities
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instant Peer Verification">
    An institution can look up its counterparty on the registry and instantly verify their identity and credentials (e.g., licenses, regulatory status) using **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**.

    This removes ambiguity and the need for third-party validation.

    **Verification Includes**:
    - KYB/KYC completion status
    - Active regulatory licenses
    - Jurisdiction of operation
    - Compliance certifications
    - Reputation scores (if applicable)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Peer-to-Peer Handshake">
    Once verified, the two institutions use the RADIUS Protocol to establish a **programmatic, end-to-end encrypted handshake** in order to pass the required compliance data and settlement instructions.

    **The Handshake Exchanges**:
    - Sender information (required for Travel Rule compliance)
    - Beneficiary information
    - Transaction details and amount
    - Settlement instructions
    - Compliance attestations

    All data is exchanged through **private, encrypted channels**—never exposed on the public blockchain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Settle Directly, On-Chain">
    Once the final handshake payload is signed by both parties, the settlement occurs **peer-to-peer on the Meridian chain**.

    The entire process—from discovery to transaction building to settlement—happens directly between the two parties.

    **Settlement Characteristics**:
    - 1-2 second finality
    - Cryptographic proof of payment
    - Immutable audit trail
    - No intermediaries
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="One-to-Many Discovery" icon="globe">
    A single integration with RADIUS enables institutions to transact with **any** vetted institution on the network. No need for bilateral relationships or custom integrations with each counterparty.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Verifiable Credentials" icon="certificate">
    Cryptographically verifiable credentials ensure authenticity without relying on centralized authorities. VCs are issued by trusted entities and can be verified instantly by any counterparty.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Privacy-Preserving" icon="lock">
    Compliance data and sensitive information are exchanged through end-to-end encrypted channels. Only settlement transactions appear on-chain, with full privacy for customer data.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Programmatic Integration" icon="code">
    Standard API interfaces make it easy to integrate RADIUS into existing systems. Automated workflows reduce manual processing and errors.

## Discovery Process

### Registry Structure

The RADIUS registry is an **on-chain smart contract** that maintains verified records of all participating institutions.

**Example Registry Entry:**

<ResponseField name="institutionId" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for the institution
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  Institution legal name (e.g., "Example Bank")
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="jurisdiction" type="string" required>
  Country code where institution is licensed (e.g., "US")
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="licenses" type="array" required>
  Array of regulatory licenses
  - `type`: License type (e.g., "MSB")
  - `number`: License number
  - `issuer`: Regulatory authority
  - `expiryDate`: Expiration date
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="services" type="array" required>
  Services offered (e.g., "remittance-receiving", "usd-offramp")
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="supportedCurrencies" type="array" required>
  Currency codes supported (e.g., ["USD", "NGN", "KES"])
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="verifiableCredentials" type="array" required>
  Cryptographically verifiable credentials
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="contactEndpoint" type="string" required>
  API endpoint for integration
</ResponseField>

### Querying the Registry

Institutions can search the registry by:
- **Geography**: Find institutions in specific countries
- **Currency**: Find institutions supporting specific currencies
- **Services**: Find institutions offering specific services (e.g., remittance receiving)
- **Licenses**: Filter by regulatory credentials

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
// Query registry for institutions in Nigeria supporting NGN
const institutions = await meridian.registry.query({
  jurisdiction: 'NG',
  supportedCurrencies: ['NGN'],
  services: ['remittance-receiving']
});

// Verify an institution's credentials
const verified = await meridian.verifyCredentials(
  institutions[0].verifiableCredentials
);
```

```python Python
# Query registry for institutions in Nigeria supporting NGN
institutions = meridian.registry.query(
    jurisdiction='NG',
    supported_currencies=['NGN'],
    services=['remittance-receiving']
)

# Verify an institution's credentials
verified = meridian.verify_credentials(
    institutions[0].verifiable_credentials
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Compliance Integration

RADIUS seamlessly integrates **FATF Travel Rule compliance** into every transaction through the encrypted handshake process.

### Travel Rule Data Exchange

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Originator Information" icon="user">
    - Full name
    - Account number or unique identifier
    - Physical address or national identity number
    - Date and place of birth (if applicable)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Beneficiary Information" icon="user-check">
    - Full name
    - Account number or unique identifier
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction Information" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    - Transaction amount
    - Currency
    - Transaction type
    - Timestamp
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

All Travel Rule data is:
- ✅ Exchanged privately between counterparties
- ✅ End-to-end encrypted
- ✅ Never exposed on the public blockchain
- ✅ Available for regulatory audits when required
- ✅ Automatically validated before settlement

## Integration Example

### End-to-End Payment Flow

```javascript
// 1. Discover receiving institution
const receivers = await meridian.registry.query({
  jurisdiction: 'KE',
  supportedCurrencies: ['KES'],
  services: ['remittance-receiving']
});

const receiver = receivers[0];

// 2. Verify credentials
const credentialsValid = await meridian.verifyCredentials(
  receiver.verifiableCredentials
);

if (!credentialsValid) {
  throw new Error('Receiver credentials invalid');
}

// 3. Initiate encrypted handshake with Travel Rule data
const handshake = await meridian.radius.initiateHandshake({
  receiver: receiver.institutionId,
  originator: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    accountNumber: '123456789',
    address: '123 Main St, New York, NY'
  },
  beneficiary: {
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    accountNumber: '987654321'
  },
  amount: '1000',
  currency: 'USD'
});

// 4. Wait for receiver to accept and sign handshake
await handshake.waitForSignature();

// 5. Execute on-chain settlement
const tx = await meridian.settle({
  handshakeId: handshake.id,
  amount: '1000',
  token: 'USDC'
});

// 6. Confirm finality
await tx.waitForFinality(); // ~1-2 seconds
console.log('Settlement complete:', tx.hash);
```
